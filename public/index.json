[{"content":" 🌍 My Journey #Unsure of which path to take in high school, I initially chose exact sciences🧑‍🔬. However, for various reasons, I switched to the social sciences path, which allowed me to study subjects like economics, geography, and philosophy. This choice provided me with some perspective and nuance about the state of the world and my own situation.\nFor several years, even during the early years of university🎓, there were some financial difficulties. I had to work to cover my gym tuition, and for a little while, I also had to work to be able to afford food and have a small modicum of fun. I was uncertain about what I wanted to do in life and had many goals across different areas, which left me feeling paralyzed by the number of options available.\nFortunately, the tough times helped me clarify what I definitely didn’t want to do in life and revealed some possible paths that could help me achieve my goals. Despite my initial career path shift, and given that I had always enjoyed experimenting with computers💻 and exploring new things in technology, I ultimately chose Computer Science as my major when it came time to decide.\nUni forced me to grow in many aspects, mainly, it helped me become a little less socially inept. I definitely could have spent my time better in university, worked harder, learned more from some great professors I had, but at least, I learned the basics, made a good amount of friends and participated in some student organizations.\nIn a stroke of mad luck🍀 and a process I can only describe as: \u0026ldquo;somehow\u0026rdquo;. I landed a job as a DevOps intern at Talkdesk a Portuguese Unicorn at the time - exactly what I wanted - I got exposed to a lot of different technologies and fantastically smart engineers, I was forced to grow as a technical person and participated in some very cool projects where I got to work with golang, python, way too much Terraform and a smattering of many other cloud related techonologies. Eventually I felt like the work was not allowing me to grow, combined with the future I saw rapidly approaching for the company and personal dilemmas I decided it was time to change companies🔄.\nI decided to accept an offer from IndieCampers to become their sole DevOps guy. It was a wild ride, there was a lot to do, and I certainly was not ready for some of the approaching challenges, we improved the security and monitoring services of the dev team, saved thousands per month by eliminating cloud redundancies, built a team with 2 other engineers👩‍💻👨‍💻, however, the company was in my opinion badly managed, issues started creeping up between the tech team and management. Eventually, management decided that people were to return to the office most of the time, which was not viable for many, this coupled with other internal issues led to most of the tech team handing in their resignations letter within the next month, myself included.\nI am now working at Worten, the largest E-commerce retailer🛒 in Portugal. I initially started as a DevOps engineer creating services on top of our CI/CD system in order to have metrics and automations that allowed the company to be more secure. I have now created a brand new AppSec team together with 2 other engineers with the same general purpose but with a much higher focus on security and providing metrics on the state of the security of the company.\nTech Stack Details ☁️ Cloud Platforms AWS Designing and managing scalable, high-performance cloud environments to support dynamic workloads. 📦 Containers \u0026amp; Orchestration Docker, Podman,ECS, Kubernetes Implementing container orchestration for seamless, reliable application deployment across diverse environments. 🔧 DevOps Tools GitLab, GitHub, Trivy, Checkov, Vault, Consul Streamlining CI/CD pipelines by integrating testing, monitoring, and security tools to maintain high code quality and system performance. 📜 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Terraform, Ansible Automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure, ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability across deployments. 💻 Programming \u0026amp; Scripting Languages **Python, Golang, Bash Crafting automation scripts and tools to optimize workflows, reduce manual interventions, and enhance system productivity. 🖥️ Systems Administration Linux Administering and securing high-availability Linux server environments to ensure robust and continuous operation of critical applications. 🔒 Security Secrets Management, SIEM, Trivy, Checkov, Secret Scanning Implementing security best practices and tools for threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and securing sensitive data. 📊 Monitoring \u0026amp; Observability Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd, Loki, New Relic Designing and managing observability solutions to monitor, analyze, and alert on system health and performance. 📂 Messaging \u0026amp; Streaming RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka Managing and optimizing messaging and event streaming architectures for scalable and resilient communication between distributed systems. 🌱 Exploration \u0026amp; Growth # Websummit 3x Just a change - Rebuilt a house União Zoófila - Organized a small fund raiser Countries visited #🇭🇺 🇮🇹 🇫🇷 🇲🇦 🇲🇹 🇵🇹 🇪🇸 🇨🇿\nInterests #My focus and hobbies shift with some regularity, however, a few remain present throught out my life with differing levels of intensity:\n🚵 Exercising and trying out new sports 🎮 Gaming 📚 Reading 🎬 Cinema 💻 Tech 🗿 History 🎙️ Politics 📬 OpenGovernance ","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Miguel Luís"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/automation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Automation"},{"content":"A collection of my thoguths semi-coherently put to virtual paper.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"","title":"Blog Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/configuration/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/convention/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Convention"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/criticism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Criticism"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/git/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Git"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/liberalism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Liberalism"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/liberatarianism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Liberatarianism"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/politics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Politics"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/tech/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tech"},{"content":" GitHub’s treatment of the original maintainer of the XZ package was sub-optimal, the course of action was understandable but it left a bad after-taste. It got me thinking, what if my account with all my incredibly cool open source projects that definitely have many fans, were to be terminated?\nSome context for those unaware of the XZ backdoor conundrum:\nI don’t want to lose my projects and badly written code, so, how do I make sure I have back-ups outside of my computer and GitHub?\nI got around setting up an environment to make sure my projects have back-ups. First I need to have accounts in different providers so I created one in GitLab and another in BitBucket, but you could also add GitTea or OneDev for those more privacy inclined.\nAfter creating the accounts, I recommend you create SSK keys associated with those providers, additionally you should create a standard key for commit signing.\nNote: You can sign git commits with SSH keys but I still prefer suffering and so I use GPG keys. Choose whatever is best for you.\nAfter adding each key to it’s respective provider, make sure you have your SSH config updated, for example:\n$cat ~/.ssh/config Host gitlab.com User git AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes ControlMaster no IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sillylab Host github.com User git AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes ControlMaster no IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/fuckmicrosoft Host bitbucket.org User git AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes ControlMaster no IdentitiesOnly yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/jirahater9000 Unemployed people need not worry too much. Employed people or open source maintainers should however be aware of how easy it is to impersonate some on git: Article\nIf like me you want to sign your commits with a GPG key, you can follow the instructions for each provider in these links:\nGithub: link Gitlab: link BitBucket: link In order to simplify this process I’ll advise you article reader. Use the same GPG key for all these providers, it makes your life easier and collaborators can check if the signature is the same between providers and trust it is really you.\nNow, all that’s missing is to understand how to push and pull to and from all the remote endpoints at once:\n# Create a remote endpoint that serves as a cath-all, in this case it\u0026#39;s \u0026#39;all\u0026#39; $git remote add all git@github.com:ElMassas/example.git $git remote set-url --add --push all git@github.com:ElMassas/example.git $git remote set-url --add --push all git@gitlab.com:ElMassas/example.git $git remote set-url --add --push all git@bitbucket.org:ElMassas/example.git To publish your code to all your remote endpoints all you need to now is:\n$git push all \u0026#34;$(git_current_branch)\u0026#34; You shouldn’t really need to worry much about pulling from the other providers if they are being used to store copies of your code, however:\n$git fetch --all That’s it.\n","date":"20 September 2024","permalink":"/posts/theres_more_than_the_git_hub/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"","title":"There's more than just the Hub"},{"content":"Como turista antagónico xuxalista, começo por dizer que foi um evento bem organizado, com oradores interessantes, num local agradável que conseguiu atrair pessoas de todo o espectro político, desde de membros do BE ao Chega e até monárquicos. À organização do evento e equipa, os meus parabéns. Alguns grupos políticos podem aprender com este tipo de eventos em que se tenta criar um ambiente de convívio e aprendizagem.\nContudo, creio que este evento foi, em algumas das apresentações e debates, muito simplista, chegando a roçar a propaganda.\nDurante o evento senti um grande problema de simplificação ou até mesmo ingenuidade, em que oradores e participantes são capazes de identificar problemas sociais, mas para os quais apresentam a solução do mercado como se fosse um feitiço mágico(Mercadus melhorum?). A solução apresentada, vezes sem fim, é concorrência e mais liberdade no mercado, sem contabilizar os desafios inerentes no mesmo, que estou certo que têm capacidade para reconhecer. Como irá a mão invisível do mercado limitar um monopólio?\nComeçámos as apresentações com uma introdução ao Liberalismo pelo professor Bruno Costa, que podia facilmente ter sido mais cautelosa e menos simplista. Durante a apresentação do professor falou-se sobre o Liberalismo com definições de liberdade pessoal, e implicações de que essa liberdade só pode ser alcançada com um estado pequeno, sem se indicarem as diferenças entre Liberalismo e Libertarianismo. Igualmente problemático nestas conversas libertárias é a identificação do abuso de poder que advém da sua acumulação no estado, sem nunca identificar as consequências que resultam da concentração do mesmo no privado.\nParticipámos também numa mesa redonda entre Francisco José Viegas e João Miguel Tavares, na qual se falou de liberdade de expressão e wokismo. Apresentou-se uma proposta do PAN sobre alteração de provérbios, que pode ser vista como censura e que ambos os interlocutores ridicularizaram. Inquiri se não achavam que no passado foi tida a mesma conversa sobre como denominar pessoas de cor ou mulheres, e que eles poderiam estar a ser reacionários. As suas respostas foram pouco satisfatórias, com o João Miguel Tavares a mencionar que todos preferem uma agressão verbal do que “levar um murro na cara”. Infelizmente não consegui perguntar se o João gostava de ter a sua esposa repetidamente ofendida em praça pública, ou se nesse caso o murro seria preferível.\nDurante toda a convenção senti este problema de simplificação ou até mesmo ingenuidade. Senti isto quando a Inês Gregório falou sobre charter schools como uma solução de mercado para o sistema educacional, em que se uma escola não conseguir obter resultados satisfatórios seria fechada sem mencionar como as crianças nessa escola seriam afetadas. Senti o mesmo quando a Zita Seabra falou sobre o 25 de Novembro sem nunca mencionar o 11 de Março. Senti o mesmo quando o Bruno Maçães falou sobre segregação em zonas de influência por parte dos EUA e China, sempre da perspectiva de ameaça chinesa, ignorando o perigo que os EUA representam. Contudo, não senti o mesmo com o António Vitorino e Jorge Moreira da Silva. Achei que foram bastante ponderados e completos nas suas análises e gostava de ter visto mais apresentações assim.\nNum evento com a Helena Ferro e o Francisco da Silva sobre o tema “Populismo, desinformação e radicalismo”, a Helena mencionou e bem o perigo da Rússia para o mundo, e exemplificou-o com o investimento russo em propaganda através de alguns podcasts como o TimCast. Curiosamente nunca mencionou os investimentos israelitas consideravelmente maiores.\nQuestionei a Helena sobre as intenções colonistas e genocidas do projeto Sionista desde a sua concepção até à atualidade, citando decisões de congressos Sionistas e líderes Sionistas como David Ben-Gurion. Achei por bem dar esta oportunidade à Helena para distanciar do seu apoio fervente a Israel, pois ela podia não saber aquilo que defende. Infelizmente a Helena sabe exatamente aquilo que defende e decidiu debitar propaganda isrealita ao dar uma resposta simplista com pontos altamente enviesados, que qualquer pessoa com o mínimo conhecimento histórico e empatia saberia rebater.\nA resposta da Helena inclui pontos como: “Israel já existe naquela zona à 3000 anos”, “Yasser Arafat era egípcio, não palestino”, “As mortes dadas no jornal Lancet são falsas e alías, já o autor veio dizer que era uma estimativa”. Curiosamente a Helena nunca respondeu aos pontos que levantei na minha questão sobre as intenções genocidas e coloniais de Israel, que de facto já foram reconhecidas pelo International Court of Justice. Achei extremamente engraçado todos os pontos que a Helena apresentou, infelizmente não tive oportunidade de responder, mas apresento aqui alguns contrapontos:\nDevemos devolver Portugal aos Italianos e voltar à glória do império Romano? Devemos ignorar que a maioria da população de Israel é emigrante oriundas da Europa ou EUA, ou devemos apontar esse facto como a Helena decidiu fazer para Yasser Arafat? Helena, minha querida criminosa. O papel que foi apresentado no Lancet é, e sempre foi uma estimativa de mortos. Uma estimativa conservadora do número de mortos. Conversas importantes sobre a comunicação social portuguesa e o seu apoio a um genocídio à parte. Este tipo de eventos são necessários em Portugal. Think tanks como o +Liberdade têm um papel fundamental de avançar o discurso político no país. Porém, é preciso reconhecer a complexidade da política e ter confiança na população portuguesa, não resumindo todas as discussões políticas a questões dogmáticas de mercado e individualismo. Os portugueses não precisam de ser salvaguardados de conversas difíceis.\n","date":"20 September 2024","permalink":"/posts/um_esquerdalhada_vai_ao_mais_liberdade/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"","title":"Um esquerdalhas vai ao + Liberdade"},{"content":" Welcome to my hub for DevSecOps, Privacy, Politics, and whatever random topic I am interested in at the moment.

Yet, despite the likelihood of the event, a visual representation of this event might very well be readily available as soon OpenAI makes SORA generally available for the public. SORA is an AI model that can create an assortment of videos from a text prompt such as the one at the beginning of the article.\nWe live in scary times where armed conflicts are popping up left and right, mass-surveillance is almost ubiquitous, climate change is an ever present threat and nations are falling back to ultra-nationalistic tropes. Sometimes it feels like there isn’t much to be hopeful about, you’re just sitting in your corner of the world trying to make a living, and in comes Artificial Intelligence waltzing through the door, with the threat of completely revolutionizing the world and upending millions and millions of lives.\nAI can be great, and in fact I use it a lot in my day-to-day job as a DevOps engineer, it’s a very powerful helper. However, I won’t lie, I see the potential it has to make many jobs disappear, and to make this point, let us go back to SORA. SORA is a remarkable technological achievement, one that seemingly has notions of physics, context and the different layers that compose a video, hence it appears to be far ahead of the competition with a lot of potential to be unlocked.\nLike with most things in life, there are positives and negatives. There are some positive cases that I can imagine and have seen referenced, such as creating videos for product prototyping, marketing videos, lowering the entry level for careers like video editors, film conception, and surely there will be more cases that I haven’t seen mentioned yet.\nDespite my feelings on the somewhat tepid positives that this AI model might bring, I see more dangers and potential risks than benefits. OpenAI says, rightfully so, that they are concerned about possible abuses of this technology, so they are working with teams and the community to make the product as safe as possible. Additionally, all contents generated by the SORA model will be identified with metadata in the C2PA standard, which I consider dangerous and have already discussed in another article.\nBefore pointing out some of the potential dangers I see in this product, I think it’s important to mention that the technology and knowledge used to create this product seem to be mostly known, in particular Diffusion models. This means it’s information that has been discovered and shared by the developer/scientific community in a somewhat transparent and open manner so that everyone can benefit from it. The technical article published by OpenAI demonstrates this fact, and also indicates that only companies in OpenAI’s position could create this model.\nIn the technical article, the team demonstrated how much computational power matters for this product. “Just” by using more computational resources, they can exponentially improve the quality of the final product. By 32xing the compute resources to produce a video, the quality of the output given the model was substantially more realistic and believable.\nThe negatives are, to me, much clearer. OpenAI is able to utilize these computational resources largely due to their partnership with Microsoft, a privilege that other companies or startups obviously do not have. The code for this and all the other models are not OpenSource, so the larger developer community can’t make sure that the users aren’t being taken advantage of. Furthermore, as is constantly demonstrated in the world of tech, it is impossible to create something without security flaws, and in this case, what will happen when someone exploits this model or improves it and makes it more accessible to the general public so that anyone with a computer can generate the video they want?\nI am very afraid of someone creating pornographic videos about someone they dislike, or combining this technology with other technologies like Deepfake and voice emulation that are becoming increasingly realistic, to create, for example, a video of Donald Trump declaring war on China.\nThe ability to create content that allows for the exponential growth of incredibly realistic misinformation is very scary to me. Even experts in the field have been surprised by the advances made in the field of AI in recent years, and our governments do not have the speed or capacity to regulate this rapid advancement to make it at least ethical, let alone to prevent the possible repercussions of these advances.New jobs will be created, many will be irrevocably altered in negative ways, misinformation will grow and it will become increasingly harder to tell what’s true and what’s not. The world is changing\nPersonally, I have no answer for this subject, and I have not seen any sufficiently satisfactory answer from the community yet, but I see my fear shared by many professionals. I believe that as a society, we have to consider to what extent technological advancement and the way it is achieved are necessary or moral, and until we find consensus on this topic, we will suffer greatly and in ways never seen before. Skynet won’t destroy humanity, but an irresponsible use of AI certainly will.\n","date":"13 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/openai_closed_future/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"The dangers that multi-modal AI agents can bring us","title":"OpenAI, closed future"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Privacy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/sora/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sora"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/video/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Video"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/c2pa/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"C2PA"},{"content":"Let’s imagine a citizen in China who wishes to anonymously share, for any reason whatsoever, an image of Winnie the Pooh — a character censored in China due to its physical resemblance to President Xi Jinping, who, in terms of character, has little in common with a teddy bear. In the near future, this citizen will face an increased risk of being easily identified by authorities due to new technology.\nC22PA is not a Star Wars robot but a technological standard led by a coalition of companies, including Adobe, BBC, and Microsoft. At first glance, they have the noble aim of combating misinformation and copyright abuses by AI and it’s users, through standardizing information production regarding media content. However, upon closer analysis of the proposed standard and associated communication beyond technical or business jargon, we encounter concerning facts, starting with the coalition’s lack of dialogue with the programming community, activists, and security experts.\nThe internet operates on standards and patterns that enable widespread communication, without programmers and other engineers needing to reinvent the wheel for each device, platform, or network — some examples of these standards among thousands are HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS. In this sense, C2PA will be just another standard — however, its format and usage are incredibly worrying.\nThe C2PA standard maintains a cryptographic record of all changes made to a file. This record includes what is called a file’s Metadata, which may include the device on which the file was created, the location, and the identity of those who created and edited the file — akin to cryptocurrencies. The coalition appears to want to enforce the mandatory implementation of this standard.\nGiven this, we return to the initial hypothetical situation of a dissident citizen living under an oppressive government. Now, the same government would know with greater precision who created the image and all accomplices who may have made some edits, thus exacerbating the machinery of political persecution and oppression of human rights.\nBeyond the persecution of dissidents by tyrants who love honey, or similar entities, there are more concerns for the general population. How might a sexual predator use this new standard to stalk victims? Who will decide what actually constitutes “fake news”? How much of our privacy are we willing to give up to achieve greater security — if this new standard indeed achieves that proposed goal? And what about its execution? How will it be implemented in different countries? Will its use be optional? Will it be possible to share files that do not comply with this standard? There are many concerns, which this article will not cover in it’s entirety.\nThe companies in question are already lobbying the US government to force widespread implementation of this standard, which would compel all modern devices to come factory-equipped with this standard implemented by default. I believe it is important to question what these companies stand to gain from this standard. What will be the business model to make the time and money spent on this project viable?\nCould it be purely for the betterment of humanity, as the coalition claims? I put to you, it is not. A former director of the US National Security Agency (Michael Hayden) once stated: “We kill people based on Metadata”. I believe that no one in good conscience, especially with historical knowledge of these companies’ business practices, would claim that as the objective.\nWe live in an era of misinformation, where it is difficult to discern reality from half-truth, half-truth from lie, reality from fiction. To combat this trend, we need clear solutions, with universal implementation, that do not endanger people’s lives and privacy. C2PA is not one of these solutions.\n","date":"4 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/c2pa_the_omnipresent_snitch/","section":"Blog Posts","summary":"","title":"C2PA the omnipresent snitch"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dystopian/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dystopian"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
