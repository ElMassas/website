## 🌍 My Journey 

Unsure of which path to take in high school, I initially chose exact sciences🧑‍🔬. However, for various reasons, I switched to the social sciences path, which allowed me to study subjects like economics, geography, and philosophy. This choice provided me with some perspective and nuance about the state of the world and my own situation.

For several years, even during the early years of university🎓, there were some financial difficulties. I had to work to cover my gym tuition, and for a little while, I also had to work to be able to afford food and have a small modicum of fun. I was uncertain about what I wanted to do in life and had many goals across different areas, which left me feeling paralyzed by the number of options available.

Fortunately, the tough times helped me clarify what I definitely didn’t want to do in life and revealed some possible paths that could help me achieve my goals. Despite my initial career path shift, and given that I had always enjoyed experimenting with computers💻 and exploring new things in technology, I ultimately chose Computer Science as my major when it came time to decide.

Uni forced me to grow in many aspects, mainly, it helped me become a little less socially inept. I definitely could have spent my time better in university, worked harder, learned more from some great professors I had, but at least, I learned the basics, made a good amount of friends and participated in some student organizations.

In a stroke of mad luck🍀 and a process I can only describe as: "somehow". I landed a job as a DevOps intern at [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/) a Portuguese Unicorn at the time - exactly what I wanted - I got exposed to a lot of different technologies and fantastically smart engineers, I was forced to grow as a technical person and participated in some very cool projects where I got to work with **golang**, **python**, way too much **Terraform** and a smattering of many other cloud related techonologies. Eventually I felt like the work was not allowing me to grow, combined with the future I saw rapidly approaching for the company and personal dilemmas I decided it was time to change companies🔄.

I decided to accept an offer from [IndieCampers](https://indiecampers.com/) to become their sole DevOps guy. It was a wild ride, there was a lot to do, and I certainly was not ready for some of the approaching challenges, we **improved the security and monitoring** services of the dev team, **saved thousands per month** by eliminating cloud redundancies, **built a team with 2 other engineers**👩‍💻👨‍💻, however, the company was in my opinion badly managed, issues started creeping up between the tech team and management. Eventually, management decided that people were to return to the office most of the time, which was not viable for many, this coupled with other internal issues led to most of the tech team handing in their resignations letter within the next month, myself included.

I am now working at [Worten](https://www.worten.pt/), the largest E-commerce retailer🛒 in Portugal. I initially started as a DevOps engineer creating services on top of our CI/CD system in order to have metrics and automations that allowed the company to be more secure. I have now created a brand new AppSec team together with 2 other engineers with the same general purpose but with a much higher focus on security and providing metrics on the state of the security of the company.
